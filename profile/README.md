# Project Magellan
We are a small team making open-source software for various niche genres of software such as game launchers and chess engines. Occasionally, we might make programs that cater to a wider range of users but our primary goal is to make software for genres with a very small selection of programs to choose from at all, or at least genres with not much options for free & open-source software. This is mostly a hobby project maintained by [myself](https://github.com/AquaCobalt) and a bunch of close friends so we are not seeking any form of sponsorship or investment. As of the time you are reading this, we have just started and our first goal is to build a Minecraft launcher!

Some inspirations for this project include [KDE](https://kde.org/), [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html) and [SynthLauncher Org.](https://github.com/SynthLauncher).

We may go by either **Project Magellan** or **Magellan Project**, named after the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan (circa 1480 ‚Äì 1521). Our little logo is supposed to loosely represent a compass, an object commonly associated with exploration and discovery.

This is our Minecraft launcher project. It is still a work-in-progress. I mainly started this as a little demo to practice my programming skills but I hope one day it could be a little more than that. I hope to finish the project by mid-2026.
