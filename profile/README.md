## Project Magellan
We are a small team making open-source software for various niche genres of software such as game launchers and chess engines. Occasionally, we might make programs that cater to a wider range of users but our primary goal is to make software for genres with a very small selection of programs to choose from at all, or at least genres with not much options for free & open-source software. This is mostly a hobby project maintained by [myself](https://github.com/AquaCobalt) and a bunch of close friends so we are not seeking any form of sponsorship or investment. As of the time you are reading this, we have just started and our first goal is to build a Minecraft launcher!

We may go by either **Project Magellan** or **Magellan Project**, named after the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan (circa 1480 â€“ 1521).
